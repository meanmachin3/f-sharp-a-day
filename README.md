During the fall 2020, I had the oppurtunity to learn Distributed Operating System. I'll be using this repo to keep my notes towards learning F#  
_F# is a strongly typed, functional-first programming language that lets you solve complex problems by writing simple code. Based on ML and built on the .NET Framework, F# offers good interoperability, portability, and run-time speed, as well as the “Five Cs”—conciseness, convenience, correctness, concurrency, and completeness_

Tutorials are great, but building projects is the best way to learn. Do project based learning and learn code the right way!
Here are the list of some project that I've created using F#

## 1. Numbers n such that there are n numbers in arithmetic progression whose squares sum to a perfect square.
For what values of n does there exist n consecutive perfect squares that add up to a perfect square?
The input provided (as command line to your program, e.g.myapp) will be two numbers:`N` and `k`.  The overall goal of your program is to find all `k` consecutive numbers starting at 1 and up to `N`, such that the sum of squaresis itself a perfect square (square of an integer).
